            <h1>Business Design 2007. Propelling your business into the 21st Century with a fresh, clean Web site template.</h1>
            <p>Lovely. A nice clean design with no HTML Validation errors and only one CSS error, and a few tiny warnings. The focus with this design was to create something professional with a modern feel. The coding is of a good standard, with only one extra div for structural purposes.</p>
            <p>My previous designs, under the guise of NOWdesign at various Open Source Web design template sites, has led to over fifty thousand downloads. This design itself is intended to replace the most popular of those designs, 'Business Design' (oswd.org & OpenWebDesign.org).</p>
            <p>My name is Tjobbe Andrews, my portfolio site at SiteCreative has more templates. For information ab0out me, visit my personal Web site.</p>
            <p>Enjoy the design!</p>
